				At Nutri.Fit, we aim to honor the sport of kickboxing in the right way too. Expect punches, elbows, knees, and kicks of all sorts during this high-energy, full body workout.

      The flow of our signature kickboxing class remains the same as our boxing fitness classes. You burn calories through a progression of warm-up drills, shadowboxing, and HIIT exercises. Youâ€™ll also endure 3-minute rounds on the heavy bag and strength work.
